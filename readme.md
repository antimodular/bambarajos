#Bambarajos

## Introduction
**Bambarajos** is a computer program originally developed for No 48-49 edition of art.es. It is an application featuring 2,400 videos of kissing couples. Every time the computer microphone hears any sound the couples change. With the arrow keys you may increase or decrease the sensitivity of the couples to sound, --this allows the kisses to synchronize to the rhythm of music, for example. 
 

## Requirements
A computer with a Mac OSX (Snow Leopard or higher), operating system. The computer must have a microphone, one Gig of RAM and 3 Gigs of hard disk. To start the program, insert the DVD-ROM, copy all the contents to your hard disk and launch the application from there
